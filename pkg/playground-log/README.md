# Package `playground/log`

This is a very simple log package, capable of logging to either stdout or a file. It's intended to be a lightweight alternative to `fmt.Printf()` that adds timestamp, category, etc.

Special thanks to Playground Global, LLC for open-sourcing this software. See `LICENSE` for details.
