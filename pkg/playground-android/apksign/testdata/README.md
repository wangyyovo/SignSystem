## Keymatter

* studio.keystore -- Java JKS generated by Android Studio; password is "android"
* singing.crt -- PEM-encoded X.509 certificate extracted from studio.keystore via commands in ../../../../README.md
* signing.key -- PEM-encoded RSA private key for signing.crt, extracted as above

In other words, these files are different representations of the same keymatter. Verifiers (i.e.
Android system package manager) should recognize APKs signed with either set of keymatter as the
same entity. Specifically, this means that an app signed by Warden using `signing.*` should be
installable over top of an app signed by `studio.keystore`, and vice-versa.

## Verifier Test Data

* app.v1.apk - signed by Android Studio under v1-only
* app.v2.apk - signed by Android Studio under v2-only
* app.both.apk - signed by Android Studio under both v1 and v2
* app.v2.stripped.apk - signed by Android Studio with both v1 & v2, but v2 stripped from zip (which is an attack)

## Signer Test Data (To Be Performed Out of Band)

* app.1.apk - signed by Android Studio under both v1 and v2; install on a device
* app.2.apk - unsigned APK w/ different version code; to be signed by Warden under both v1 and v2; test that Android accepts this via `adb install -r`

## Tests to Write

* Need to construct an APK with modified contents to confirm digests work
* Need to sign APK with unsupported scheme (e.g. ECDSA)
* Couldn't hurt to test individual source files, e.g. manfiest/SF parsing
* Should test w/ SHA512
