/* This idiom is very common in the v2 Android signing scheme:
   val := binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(buf) // parse 4 bytes into a uint32
	 buf = buf[4:]													// advance the buffer past the "consumed" bytes

	 ...and same for uint64 values.

	 It's not a lot of code but when it appears many times in succession it detracts from readability
	 and is prone to typos and copy/paste bugs. So we wrap this in a few convenience functions to
	 improve this. The compiler generally seems to inline calls to these.
